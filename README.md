# WebGL-Demo
Simple WelGL demo which allows users to create and manipulate a scene of 3D objects in real time, as well as save the data of the objects in their scene.

You can view a live demo on my webpage [here.](https://people.ucsc.edu/~ccnorris/WebGLdemos/WebGL-Demo/)

If you are interested in creating 3D Web graphics yourself, feel free to check out my guide on building 3D Product Displays in WebGL and three.js [here.](https://people.ucsc.edu/~ccnorris/threejs-guide/Threejs%20for%203D%20Product%20Displays.pdf)
